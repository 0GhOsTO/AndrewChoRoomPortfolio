          <p>Hello, my name is Andrew Cho. I’m a computer scientist studying at Boston University, working toward a Bachelor’s degree.

            I have always surprised by how code works and how programming languages are designed. When I first
            learned how to describe code mathematically, I was genuinely surprised by how thoughtfully the languages are
            constructed. That was the moment that made me to pursue Computer Science and how software is made.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lately, I have been diving in to machine learning, starting from EM and SVD. I found myself enjoying
            the logic and the process, so now I am studying more about the foundations of machine learning and software engineering in depth.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of academics, I spend time playing guitar and drawing. These hobbies helped me to realize the
            importance of working with others(teamwork). While playing guitar in the band, I had to listen
            and sync with the bass, drums, and vocals. It showed me that collaboration does matters. Drawing taught
            me that there's never just one solution on problem: everyone sees the same object in different perspective.
            Coding feels the same. Even if I think my solution is perfect, someone else might approach it better. Drawing
            helped me to learn how much I can learn from other people.
          </p>

          <p>Whether it's through code, art, or music, I am always looking for ways to express ideas and solve
            problems in ways that can build connection with others. </p>
